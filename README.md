# Github's Game of Life

Github's game of life is a userscript written in vanilla javascript that allows you to perform a cellular automata simulation on you, or anyone's Github contributions map.

Works in the latest version of Firefox and Chrome, for the Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey add-ons respectively.
